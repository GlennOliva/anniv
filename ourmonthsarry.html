As I sit down to write this letter to you, my heart is overflowing with love and gratitude. These past two months have been some of the happiest of my life, and I am so grateful to have you by my side.

From the moment I met you, I knew there was something special about you. Your kindness, your humor, and your unwavering support have all combined to make you the perfect partner for me. I am so thankful for each and every moment we have spent together, and I am even more excited for all of the adventures we have yet to embark upon.

As we celebrate our second month anniversary, I want you to know just how much you mean to me. You bring joy into my life in ways I never thought possible, and I am constantly in awe of the person you are. I am so grateful to have you in my life, and I am looking forward to continuing to grow and learn with you.

I love you more than words can express, and I will always cherish you with all my heart. Here's to many more months and years of love and happiness!

Yours always, <br><br>

                        scripted in the time being. May we continue to love each other at all times.

                        Sometimes, having a perfect relationship is all but a myth, a fairytale, a fable, or a false hope. But for us, it has been a case of coming out the demands that comes with relationship, to living a loving life where you and I can’t stop thinking about the bond that exists between us,
                         and how we plan spending the rest of our lives together. It’s our 1st anniversary already . I am using this opportunity to say thank you for the love, peace, and harmony we share as a happy-progressive couple. May the blessings of the Lord continue to guide us in this relationship, and may we continue to live a full and joyous life together for many more years yet to come Happy 1st anniversary.
